# 2D Top Down Game

## Aims

I want this game to be a top down game with art inspired by classic Gameboy games like Pokemon and Zelda with the "souls-like" dodge system and bosses with multiple phases and attack patterns. This will be a large undertaking and will just be a side project for me to get better as a game dev and to develop my skills where they are lacking (art, 2D games and in-depth enemy mechanics).

## Art Style

As mentioned above this game should remind the player of old-school games. To do this I will use 16x16px sprites and a very limited colour palette. I found a palette online called Velvet Cherry GB (available here https://lospec.com/palette-list/velvet-cherry-gb) that I really like the look of as I love the colour purple. This limited colour palette and small sprite sizes will hopefully meet my aims of a retro style while still being appealing to modern audiences.
